# Inbox for documentation

This is the place to put all un-categorized parts of documentation (just as sometimes it doesn't fit anything exactly, but we don't want to lose it).

- Contrib modules are forked to [Code-Driven Drupal](https://github.com/orgs/CodeDrivenDrupal) Github "organization"
- Contrib module may be in 3 main branches: "master" - the default branch, if the module wasn't changed, except adding `composer.json` file; "develop" - if the module was changed and the change has value for the module in general (like a patch from the community that hasn't made it way to the next module release); "xtuple" - if the change in the module was done for xTuple development purposes only.
